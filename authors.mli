   Academic Integrity Statement

   We have fully reviewed the
   course academic integrity policies.  We have adhered to those policies in
   solving the assignment.

   The policies do permit some limited collaboration among students currently
   enrolled in the course. If we did engage in such collaboration, here is the
   list of other students with whom we collaborated, and a brief summary of that
   collaboration:
